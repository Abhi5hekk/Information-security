# Oblivious Transfer
### Introduction

An oblivious transfer (OT) protocol is a type of protocol in which a sender transfers one of potentially many pieces of information to a receiver, but remains oblivious as to what piece (if any) has been transferred. The receiver is also oblivious of the non accepted messages transmitted by the sender.<br/>
Oblivious Transfer is a fundamental building block for more complex cryptographic protocols such as secure multiparty computation protocols.
